    "\n",
    "Understanding the *type* of data you are working with is the most important first step in any data-related task. It dictates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **How you store it:** Do you use an integer, a string, a list of dictionaries?\n",
    "2.  **What you can do with it:** You can calculate the average of student heights, but you can't calculate the average of their names.\n",
    "3.  **How you clean it:** Finding a negative age is an error, but finding a negative temperature might be valid.\n",
    "4.  **How you visualize it:** You use a bar chart for categories but a line chart for data over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like being a chef. Before you can cook, you must understand your ingredients: Is it a vegetable or a fruit? Does it need to be chopped, boiled, or baked? Getting this wrong leads to a bad meal. In programming, getting data types wrong leads to bugs and bad analysis."
